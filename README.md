# OpenAlchemy
OpenAlchemy is part of a broader effort to democratize biotechnology through open source sharing. The software can be used to automate the metabolic design of organisms to build new molecules (free medicine) or to break down old ones (like plastics). It will also be possible to use this software to predict ecological networks.

Input: Desired molecule
Output: DNA sequences to add to organism
