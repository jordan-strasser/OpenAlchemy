# OpenAlchemy
Input: Molecule,
Output: DNA seqs to build it!

OpenAlchemy is part of a broader effort to democratize biotechnology through open source sharing. The software can be used to automate the metabolic design of organisms to build new molecules (free medicine) or to break down old ones (like plastics).
