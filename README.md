# OpenAlchemy
OpenAlchemy generates the DNA code to build new molecules (open-source medicine) and break down old ones (like plastics). This can be used to automate the metabolic design of cells for purposes such as carbon-neutral biomanufacturing, logical RNA medicines, and environmental bioremediation.

As a user, input the name of the desired molecule, a chassis organism's Genbank ID, and a catabolism/anabolism flag. The output is the collection of enzymes and associated genes that need to be added to this organism to start making/breaking a compound.

Coming soon: 
- RNN enzyme dreaming to deal with novel compounds
- UI/UX to improve accessibiity and workflow
- Regulatory checks to assess compatibility of genes relative to the user's local ecology. 

Help/collaboration is very welcome!
